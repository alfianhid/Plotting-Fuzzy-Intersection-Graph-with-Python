Fuzzy logic is a reasoning that has a truth value in the range between 0 and 1. In real life, we may find a situation where we can not decide whether the statement is true or false. At that time, fuzzy logic offered very easy flexibility in order to produce optimal decisions.

This repository contains the script or the source code on how to plot or make a chart of fuzzy sets using Python.
